0.4.7:

  - get it to compile and run with TypeScript 1.5-beta

0.4.6:

  - split into vim plugin (typescript-tools.vim) and commandline server (typescript-tools)

0.3.1 to 0.4.5:

  - get it to compile and run with github version of TypeScript (1.5-alpha), see #39

  - 'type' command renamed to 'quickInfo' (follows LS API naming)
    (old version is still accepted, but deprecated)

  - 'navigateToItems' command is new (:TSSnavigateTo in Vim)

  - 'navigationBarItems' command is new (:TSSnavigation in Vim)

  - 'structure' command (:TSSstructure in Vim) is gone (try 'navigationBarItems' instead)

  - 'signature' command is new

  - 'references' command: add 'lineText' field (#45, :TSSreferences in Vim)

  - 'completions' command: boolean no longer required

  - support tsconfig.json file and commandline options (#44,#49)

  - improve dependency chasing:
    - don't build a Program before creating language service
    - support loading new files after language service has started

  - Vim: add type to preview info for :TSStype and Omni-Completion (helps with #46)

  - fix #35 (error handling and "tss not running" message)

  - fix script lookup existence check (#47)

  - accept multiple root files (#49)

  - follow LS API change in 'showErrors' ('text' field can be a message chain, #52)

  - API fix 'showErrors': global  errors have no file-related fields

0.3.0 to 0.3.1:

  - update TS to v0.9.1-2505-g18875cc (develop branch)

  - fix #32 (EOLs in bin)

  - fix #33 (-1 return in TSScompleteFunc)

0.2.2-1 to 0.3.0:

  - update TS to v0.9.1-2130-g0c53b50 (develop branch, about TS v1.0 release)

  - fix tss command help

  - fix #23 (bin/tss executable bit)

  - primitive types have no completion details #29

  - tss.vim:
    - change `TSSstructure` to popup nagivation menu
    - add `TSSfile`: quickly open project files, with filename completion
    - add `TSSfilesMenu`: quickly open project files, with popup navigation menu
    - add sample keymap
    - guard against tss not running/no python
    - only use shell on windows; fixes #18
    - improve TSSstatus();"tss not running" handling #29

0.2.1 to 0.2.2-1:             NOTE: package name changed!

  - same code as 0.2.1, packaged slightly differently:

    - package name changed from `tss` to `typescript-tools`
      (matches repo name, is descriptive and easier to find
       in package lists)

      NOTE: remember to uninstall previous version (named `tss`)

    - Vim plugin reorganised as a filetype plugin
      (so you can just add the repo path to Vim's runtime path
       and enable filetype plugins)

0.2.0 to 0.2.1:

  - store project files in dependency-first order
    (avoids some spurious type errors)

  - updated TS to v0.9.1-376-gad18600

  - patch for #15 (TS issue 1651)

  - several fixes in file `update` handling

  - `update`: show syntax/semantics error count (works around TS issue 1592),
    distinguish updated from added files (highlights file addition accidents);
    for speed in combination with completions, use `update nocheck`, with fallback
    to full `update` when `completions` fails (cf #13,#14)

  - fixes in `completions`, `definitions`, and `showErrors`

  - add `--version` flag, use 'git describe --tags' for versioning

  - improved tests and commandline debugging; add basic Makefile

  - improved file path resolution and normalization

  - `showErrors`: provide category of diagnostic (error/warning)
    and phase which generated it (resolution/syntax/semantics)

  - add `structure` command (getScriptLexicalStructure)

  - tss.vim: rudimentary support for
      - showing file structure `TSSstructure`
      - listing project files `TSSfiles`
      - browsing MDN docs for EcmaScript global object properties&methods

  - partial rewrite, including PROTOCOL CHANGES
    (outlined below, see README.md for details of current protocol)

  - tss v0.2 supports/uses TypeScript v0.9

  - `symbol` command is gone
    (use `type` command instead, properties `fullSymbolName` and `type`)
